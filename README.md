# Mapbox Android Services (MAS)

An open source toolset for building applications that need directions, geocoding, or static map imagery. Two libraries are at your disposal: a **Java library** compatible with any Java application and an **Android library** intended to be used specifically for Android applications.

### Features

**Java & Android:**

* [x] Integrate with the [Directions API](https://www.mapbox.com/directions/)
* [x] Integrate with the [Geocoding API](https://www.mapbox.com/geocoding/)
* [x] Integrate with the [Map Matching API](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/map-matching/)
* [x] Integrate with the [Static Image API](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#static)
* [x] [Line simplification](https://www.mapbox.com/android-sdk/examples/polyline-simplification/)
* [x] Geospatial analysis functionality, adapted from the [Turf](http://turfjs.org/) project
* [x] RouteUtils for detecting when a user or marker location becomes off route
* [x] Tidy which cleans noisy GPS traces removing repetitive coordinates from a GeoJSON Feature Collection

**Android:**

* [x] Ready-to-go geocoder input view with autocompletion.
* [x] Drop-in replacement for stock Android Geocoder object.

### Installation

To install and use MAS in an application, see the [Mapbox Android Services website](https://www.mapbox.com/android-sdk/#mapbox_android_services).

### Sample code

Check the [Android Test App](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-java/tree/master/libandroid/app) for examples or download the [Mapbox Demo App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapbox.mapboxandroiddemo) to see what's possible with Mapbox Android Services. You can also visit the [Mapbox Android SDK examples page](https://www.mapbox.com/android-sdk/examples/) for additional code examples.
